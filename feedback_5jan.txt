lore feedback:

Too few choices 

one chapter is super long 

make all chapters even length. 

edit down the names in the first pass. 

have a snippet of the chapter text along with the question

if the choices are more grounded, the reader feels more invested in the choice, whereas with the fantastical choices, it's more a matter of preference. 

grounded vs fantastical branches set expectations depending on which path you first choose. 

with fewer endings you can keep people more engaged (like bandersnatch does). 

iridescent is overused - use synonyms (opalescent). describe the color more, rather. 

recode with fragments to see the whole picture

add a bookmarks side bar where you can see all the bookmarke pages. that's kind of like people keep their finger on the previous choice page. 

should everything just be a web app with a javascript voice to text? https://demo.tutorialzine.com/2017/08/converting-from-speech-to-text-with-javascript/
